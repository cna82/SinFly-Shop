Hi every body , this is the finall edition of my project.
My goal was reach to a sampled aviation office site with React-JS features :
I used some dependencies and features such as :

⚪ creating a typical Api using Express-JS (node-JS , nodemon ,mongoDB,Cors ,body parser ...)
⚪ Fetching and storing datas (in staets) and abort them by demand
⚪ Using React-router-dom to handle routes (Dynamic & Static)
⚪ Using custom hooks
⚪ Using context to share datas whole pages
⚪ Using utility first css libraries such as (tailwind css - bootstrap 5)
⚪ Using Css modules
⚪ Using React-hook-form to manage Login and Sign up section
⚪ Using MUI features such as (Skeleton,Rating,animations ,...)
⚪ Using React-Helmet to manage dynamic titles
⚪ Using Swiper-Js to create sliders
⚪ Using Email-JS to send an email from clients to : sinarahimi1382@gmail.com
⚪ Using React-Toastify to show toast messages
⚪ Using Sweet-Alert to show alerts
...

Special thanks to dear teacher Ali Azimi to guiding the project.

I hope you enjoy it ,
